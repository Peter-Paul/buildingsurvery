                        measure polar ice-caps. Land surveyors work in the office and in the field â€“ from suits to
                        boots.</p>

                                        but you can ask the surveyor to provide one. The valuation from a full survey
                                        will be more accurate than the lender's valuation because it looks at value on
                                        the open market and it will provide you with a better tool with which to
                                        negotiate on price.
